# INTRODUCTION TO RECURSION

- Most tutorials introduce recursion with some inconvienient examples
- For instance, using fibonacci sequence and factorial examples
- These 2 problems present recursion as very inappropriate for most beginners
- These is because the 2 have iterative approaches which are always faster
- Recursive method present with very repetitive tasks requiring a huge amount of
    time for their computation. These 2 examples are presented using factorial.py
    and fibonacci.py files in the module
